## The mise-an-abyme of the adultery novel
[… todo]

Why did Flaubert write this novel?
- Is it a profanation of the sacred?
- Or a sacralisation of the profane?

"The lyric legion of these adulteruos women"
- She is happy not because of her lover but by the having of a lover

"So beautiful in books"
- Real love was around her all the time in the figure of her father's love for her mother
	- Pure, sacrificial, timeless
- At the end discovers the love for her

## II Defining adultery
The word adultery:
Part 1: nothing

Part 2:
- 'Domestic mediocrity drove her to lews fancies, marriage...'
At the end of part 2 there is the dissilution of adultery; the same dissapointment with marriage in part 1 occurs with adultery in part 2.
Part 3:
Adultery openly compared to poison.

An ominous ride. Part 1 Ch IX.
Ominous
Erotic
Sad and bleak atmosphere (October)

Discrepancy between how Emma feels and the banality of what has happened.
Adultery is a huge matter in how it affects an individual, it does not need to be some influential figure.

## III Aspects of Emma's adultery
### A premonitory wedding
Spending issue. No excitement for the marriage (Emma). Emma is not fulfilled.

### Sensuality
- Senses: touch. Silk, velvet.
- Bourgeois comfort: 
- Voluptuousnes: she is described as voluptuous in how she moves, how she looks, and how she dresses. We see her as the object and subject of sensuality.
- Damnation: wants to be interesting through damnation. Flaubert contemporary to *Flowers of Evil*
### Melancholy
- Isolation
- Boredom
- Desire for desire
- Depression?
She feels empty and trapped in her life. She does not desire her parteners, she desires the passion and desire (the wish to feel something). 

**Bovarysm** (Like 'Don Quixotism')
A desire to escape from one's conditions through luxury, travels, windows, religion, novels, marriage, lovers, and maybe death.

### Emma's Death
Why is Emma's death described the way it is? Why is it so long and detailed?

Convention of the genre, perhaps, the adulterous woman must die.
- Flaubert adds some twist to this
	- Does she die simply just because she was adulterous?
	- Greed or Lust?
	- Flaubert is using a voice of "The author as God", the author is everywhere but is absent. Flaubert is refusing the conventional use of the author as God the moraliser. Space is left for sympathy.
		- Reason for some of the controversy, not only does Flaubert write something seen as perverse, he does not provide some sort of moral condemnation but leaves the reader to decide!

Remember, this is not the end of the novel!
There are a few more pages about the others.
There is no social nor divine justice at the end of the novel.

## IV The Setting
Emma is torn between the "Here" that she despises and rejects and the "There" which she dreams of but cannot reach (she is a woman)

The Stucture!
- 'Plot' vs 'Story'
	- Plot: order in which events happen to characters
	- Story: order in which events are told to readers
- Traditional Sturcture
	- Chronological progression
	- Circle of life (realism) = no escape
	- Closed ending = no escape!
- Parallel structure
	- Repetitions, mirror effect, eternal return of the same = no escape

### The Here
1. 19th Century Female Condition
2. Reality - Provincial Life
3. Domesticity
4. Bougeoisie
5. La Vaubyessard
	1. Lots of circles: hypnotic, like a whirlpool, circular lack of escape
	2. Allusion to Cinderella (here the motif is of the cigar box, in Cinderella it is the glass slipper)
	3. 
6. Rouen
	1. It is the in-between of the here and reality. It is very sad, she dreams of Pais, the alps, etc., and all she gets is Rouen. Parallel to her adultery with Rodolfo

### The There
1. Fantasy
	1. Flaubert splits the setting into realities which are there and fantasies which are not there, but are still described
	2. Real and Described: La Vaubyessard, Rouen
	3. Imaginary, yet described as well: Paris, romantic landscapes, exotic islands
2. Romantic Dreams
3. Paris

## V Realism
Realism as a movement
- Mostly affecting prose fiction, mostly novels
- 19th Century Europe
- Reality as it is in its bleak and grim form
- Often seen as a social critique of the bleakness, grimness and decadence

Realism as a technique
- Transgression of the norm: whenever you see an object, study it for what it represents.
	- Using details in a different way. The story is crowded with details which play no role.
	- Details still have a symbolic function, but there are so many
	- Importance of setting and space 
	- Reification of people
	- Personification of objects: objects have a meaning and life of their own (Emma's clothes through the gaze of other men)
	- Flaubert is criticising bourgeois consumerism through the reification of people and personification of objects. We have the impression that we do not have peole invited, but coats and hats. We have the impression that objects become the subject, clothes become symbols for Emma's sensuality

The 'real effect' (Roland Barthes, 'L'effet de réel')

> Art is not reality. Whatever we do, we must choose between the elements it gives us

(Flaubert, Feb-March 1879)

Cf. Impressionism

Flaubert is creating a very visual and atmospheric *impression* of reality

Flaubert's novel as a cinematographical story
Describing is greater than telling a story
- Everything is told through objects & settings
Description is equal to or greater than the action
A cinematic prose:
Slow motion
Switches between characters
Panoramic shots 
Close-ups
Changes in focus (wide descriptions to small details)

Flaubert is directing our gaze in a way modern film-viewers are familiar with

Beauty in/and reality

> Above anything else, I am searching for beauty
(Flaubert, 1857)

Flaubert maybe did not find the idea for Madame Bovary through the cannonical genre and conventions, but in a normal news article in which he saw beauty where many only felt disgust.

> In order for a thing to be interesting, one has only to look at it does a long time
(Flaubert, Sept. 1845)

For the Viscount who drops the ciggar box, it means nothing; for Emma, it means everything.

## VI The Characters
How do we know x about a character through the novel?
| Direct                                                                                                                                    | Indirect                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Through telling us                                                                                                                        | Through showing us                                                                                                                                                                           |
| "she was full of a gloomy melancholy, of a numb despair", in this perspective it is the omniscient narrator, in others it may be filtered | Through onomastics (Emma vs. Bovary): Emma is a name tied to romance; Bovary is a name tied to the provincial. Rodolf and Leon are also tied to romance                                      |
|                                                                                                                                           | Through actions and speech. You don't need Flaubert's narrator to tell you what Charles feels, only to show you his sadness in his actions. Rodolf's speech to himself reveals his character |
|                                                                                                                                           | Through physical appearances, and through objects and settings attached to a character                                                                                                       |

Mlle Rouault/ Mlle Emma/ Mme Bovary/ Emma
- The reader is teased as to who is Madame Bovary at first
- Few objective perspectives
	- her own
	- men who desire her
	- women who judge her
- We don't really see Emma as a subject, only really as an object?

Charles/ Charbovary
"Charles's conversation was commonplace as a street pavement, and everyone's ideas trooped through it in everyday garb…"
This is Emma's perspective

The Lovers: Rodolphe and Léon
- Empty shells for Emma's fantasies
	- A sad embodiment of Emma's romance. They are not fleshed out by Flaubert
- Pale versions of Emma's fictional ideals
- Tragic irony: the reader knows more
	- At first Emma does not know they are these pale versions, the reader does know this through access to their thoughts. Emma as she progresses through the novel is able to recognise this as she becomes more cynical. The realisation of her ideals being empty shells and pale versions of her fantasies and ideas may spark her suicide?
- Why two of them?
	- More would be serial adultery rather than desire to escape
	- Creates more room for parallels and dissatisfaction increasing
	- The replacement of marriage with adultery, then adultery with death?
	- Traditionally in the genre there is only 1 lover.

Emma's daughter
- "What an ugly child she is!"
