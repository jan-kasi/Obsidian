## L1
Theodor Fontane's *Effi Briest*

Fontane started off as a journalist
Concision in description compared to other 19th century writers.


Effi's attitude toward's marriage are naive. She simply repeats what others say. She similarly just accepts her fate?

The phrases of society.

## L2
The danger of imagination.

Does Innstetten turn out to be correct: is Effi's tendency to listen to stories lead to her affair, and to pay for this with her happiness.

She is not looking for an affair, she will not come to love Crampas. These things just sort of happen to her.
Effi's need for distraction and constant boredom.

Rocking motif with Effi: swing, rocking chair,

After her affair she is surprised and shocked at herself for how easily lies and deceptions come to her. After her affair her passions seem inauthentic and as if playing a role.

Narrator, rarely, intevenes to inform the reader that "Crampas knew women enough not to interfere with the natural course of events".

**Dogs in Fontane are symbols of fidelity.** and often right.

Effi cannot send Crampas away. She is trapped by society and its rules into adultery but then later condemned for breaking them in adultery.

### The concept of moral character
Joel Kupperman, *Character*, 

It is less important whether the principles are right or not, than the ability to integrate them into personality and live consistently by them to have moral character.

Early 19th Century Ralph Waldo Emerson read in Europe.

### Character Theme in *Effi Briest*
- Innstetten introduced as a 'man of character', a 'man of principles' in Ch1; a manipulator (Chinaman stories)? Does Innstetten maintain his distance?
- Effi's lack of principles presented by her and by Innstetten as inherent in her, preparation for the affair -- 'no principles' (she says, Ch4), swing, 'something out of the ordinary' (i.e. she is high spirited and lacks self restraint)
- Innstetten lacks real character/distinction, or a criticism of character doctrine.
- The people with real character tend to be oddities: Giesh√ºber

The novel seems a criticism of the moral system given at the start. Yes, Effi commits adultery and gives in to her imagination etc., but Innstetten's claimed moral character does not save him either; and Effi returns home, in a sense, and her gravestone has her own real name at the end.
