1. Find an interesting motif (symbol, image, object) in Effi Briest and give page numbers for where it occurs. Briefly explain what you think its function is and how it relates to the themes of the novel.
The idea of social correctness, or righteousness, or having "principle" is mentioned early in the novel first in relation to Innstetten, when Effi is frightened of this because she feels she "has none". This distinction between the following of natural impulses and behaviour, such as Effi's ability to go without something but being unable to have the second-best and only wanting the very best, and the artificial following of some principle is consistent throughout the novel; for example when Innstetten kills Crampas. The motif of having moral character or principle is contrasted with the motif of natual impulse and naïvety throughout the novel, with Innstetten as the flawed exaple of Principle and Effi as the flawed example of Naïve Impulse.

2. To what extent may the narrative be said to be objective?
The narrative has a significant amount of dialogue. Most of what could be said to not be objective about the novel would come through this direct speech from the characters, where the reader may be unaware whether to trust the meaning which Fontane imprints into the characters' speech. However, this only makes the novel more objective in its narrative. By representing speech, tone and meaning as subjective and counterbalanced by other people's speech and actions, Fontane represents human interactions and behaviours quite objectively. In the very few times the narrator obviously intervenes to directly comment on events it seems less like a moralising or narrative imposition upon the realism of the novel, and more like an expression of an objective expression at the social and personal situations. For example the "Poor Effi" moment discussed in the Lectures (page 124).

3. Do you think there is a moral to the novel? If so, what is it?
Effi's characterisation as and symbolism of a child-like person opens and ends the novel. The opening scenes of the novel seem almost a performance of a socially respectable Bourgeois interaction: the mother and daughter diligently work on an altar cloth in the garden, the daughter behaving in a childish way occasionally, then the group of girls listening attentively to the story about Innstetten. When the parents discuss whether she was "too young" and they are partly to blame, only to dismiss this as too difficult a question, Fontane could be said to critise the Bourgeois society's willing ignorance and imposition of social values on the more natural child-like behaviour humans act in. Because Effi later feels a lack of passion and as someone simply performing an act after her adultery, an action symbolising the trangression of a social order, the novel could also be read as a criticism or observation that in society performance is valued over authenticity. This is to the extent that, without a rift in the social performance, this inauthentic performance is believed to be the natural behaviour wheras the natural impulses of human behaviours are seen as a wish to escape the natural order, rather than the reverse.

Motif of water present throughout but in different ways. Water is quite menacing as a presence, especially opposed to Effi being called a daughter of the air.

Conflict between reality and fantasy seems to be something in common between these novels of adultery.

Both *Madame Bovary* and *Effi Briest* take the names of the novel after the main protagonist/adulterous woman.

Emma seems more mature/sophisticated than Effi.
Their relationships with their husbands and reasons for marriage and adultery are very different.

Effi's adultery was slightly glossed over and seems more like something which just happened, opposed to Emma's almost obsession after her adultery.

Effi is characterised as a young, innocent, almost immpressionable person who falls into both Crampas and Innstetten's manipulations.

Consequences on subsequent generations could be a similarity between the novels Madame Bovary and Effi Briest.

In Effi Briest is adultery necessary, or just that Effi do something which is seen as very wrong, for the plot and disowning etc...?
