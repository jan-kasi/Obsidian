## Introduction: Gender roles in the novel of adultery
- Male/Female writer
- Male/Female adulterer

## Performing Gender
Butler's influence

### In *Madame Bovary*
#### Gender Stereotypes
1. Homais: "I care litttle who has placed us here below to fulfil our duries as citizens and parents (*père de famille*)" (66)

#### The Escape to the feminine condition
1. Emma Bovary rejects the traditional role of woman and wife
	1. She smokes, she …
	2. 'As to the piano, the more quickly her fingers glided over it the more he [Charles] wondered. She struck the notes[…]From all this, much consideration was extended to Bovary' (36)
		- There is perhaps a small rebellion in her way of playing
	3. 'He was becoming her mistress rather than she his' (216) 
2. 

### In *House of Ulloa*
#### Feminine traits of Julían
Manly priesthood = chastity and suffering (typically feminine attributes)

Julián's feminisation could be seen as a radical act of feminiastion of the church and appropriation of holiness/being good as the feminine.

#### Don Pedro and hyper-masculinity
- Exaggerated masculinity
- Huntsman (wildfowl and women!)
- Uncle Don Gabriel "brough Don Pedro up in his won image, taking him to fairs, hunts, fêtes and probable also to less innocent entertainments, and all the while instructing him in the art of hunting the white partridge, as the pursuit of the fairer sex is called in those parts" (52)
- Yet he does not manage to uphold masculine authority
- Town life threatens his masculinity

Suggests that these performances of gender as fallible and that these novels are aware that these genders are performed.

## Gender, madness and adultery
There is a clear relation between ideas of gender and madness in the 19th century.
Gender is linked to madness in both novels written by women and men, but it is always related to women.

Almost all deviant behaviour was considered pathological; not a problem in the mind but a problem with the body/anatomy.

Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar, *The Madwoman In The Attic* (New Haven: Yale UP, 1979) 'patriarchal socialization literally makes women sick, both physically and mentally' (53)

- '**The female malady**' (Elaine Showalter)
- **Hysteria**: from the greek *Hystera* (womb)
- 'Emma began to laugh, a strident, piercing, continuous laugh; she had am attack of hysterics (*attaque de nerfs*)' MB (216)
- 'she [Nuncha] started screming hysterically' HU (202)

**Obsession**
- 'she [Nuncha] talked to herself quietly as obsessed people sometimes do' HU (227)
- **Male doctors**: Homais, Dr Juncal

## The Female Body
1. Fear of female sensuality
	- Julián 'wanted to avoid looking at Sabel, whose appearance had distrubed him from the first moment, despite the fact that she was a good-looking, buxon young woman […]' HU (14)
2. Weakness and Nerves
	- Emma Bovary's 'nervous condition'
	- 'Their nervous system is much more fragile than ours' MB (100)
	- 'the nervous impulsiveness of a woman' HU (165)
	- 'nervous women only regain their health if they're kept happy' HU (227)
