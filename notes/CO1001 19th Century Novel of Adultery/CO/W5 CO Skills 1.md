# Writing a Comparative Commentary
```toc
```
- Focused on detailed close reading
- About how these passages function and are situated in the novel as a whole
	- Everything you mention about the wider novel must be realted to what you are saying about the passage

## Formatting and Referencing
- Must be double-spaced
- You should consult the style guide in the SoML Undergraduate handbook, MHRA style.
- You should include a bibliography as a matter of good academic practice even if you only refer to the primary texts
	- You don't need lots of secondary reading as this is not the focus for this commentary, it is about close reading.
Word Limit:
- 1500 words, including footnotes and titles but not bibliography. SoML deduced 1 mark for essay over 10% word limit, 2 marks for over 20%
Edition:
- Use the correct suggested edition (or the scans on Moodle)
Submission:
- Electronically on MMS
- Marks deduced for late submissions
## What is a Comparative Commentary?
- A close comparative analysis of two short passages, which demonstrates:
	1. What effects they produce,
	2. And how they work.
- More interested in *how the writer communicates what they want to say* , not *what they say* or *what they are doing*.

Comparing two passages
- Make sure you emphasise what they have in common and what they differ in.
- What does the comparison of the passages tell you about the novels as a whole?

It is not an a description of the passages
	- You want to briefly give some context but this is not the main body of your analysis
It is not an essay about the texts as a whole
	- You may have relevant things to say about the rest of the book, but you must use the passages as your starting point and main focus
It is not a discussion of secondary sources about the text
It is not an opportunity to write down everything you know or have read about the text or the author
- Secondary sources and contextual knowledge are useful to help you approach the passages as an informed reader and be able to analyse them convincingly. However, you shouldn’t include this material in your commentary unless it is directly relevant to a point you are making about the passage.
- Include a full list of works cited.

## Possible structures
These are suggested sections for your commentary/essay, not gigantic paragraphs!

Structure 1
1. Introduction
2. Context (similarities and differences)
3. Techniques (similarities and differences)
4. Themes (similarities and differences)
5. Conclusion: what does analysis and comparison of these two passages tell us about the novels as a whole?

Structure 2
1. Introduction
2. Passage 1 (context, techniques, themes)
3. Passage 2 (context, techniques, themes)
4. Similarities/Differences: what does analysis and comparison of these two passages tell us about the novels as a whole?
5. Conclusion
(2 and 3 roughly equal size/content)

Structure 2 can be easier to manage and understand, sometimes!

## How to prepare
| Wide angle view of both texts                   | 'Zoom shot' detailed analysis |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| what kind of passage                            | types of language             |
| structure and form                              | images                        |
| what characters are involved                    | rhetorical devices            |
| what is the purpose or main idea of the passage | sounds                        |
| what kind of narration/pov                      | adjectives, adverbs           |
| what are the main themes                        | tenses                        |
| etc.                                            | etc.                          |
 

## Wide-angle analysis
### Narrative voice and perspective
- They can be extra/intradiagetic, first/second/third-person, omniscient, etc.
- Are there one or more focalisers? (a character whose perspective the narrator chooses to be filtered through)
- Why?
### Place
### Cliché
## How to write-up
### Introduction
> What you are introducing is **the passages and your analysis of them**, not anything else

You should:
- Provide a clear introduction,
- Placing the passages in their context within the novels,
- Noting why they are comparable,
- And stating, in order, what aspects you will be discussing.

You might want to point out your direction of argument/purpose of what it will be about, hinting your conclusion, instead of what saying exactly what your conclusion relating to this will be.
- e.g. "To evaluate whether/the/… [bla bla]"

You should not make general comments about the text as a whole, the lives of the authors, or anything not directly related to the passages!
- If these aspects *are* relevant to your passage, you **must** make it clear why; this must be **integrated** into your own argument!
- If it would help you, you could write this and then in a new paragraph a proper and precise introduction. Then go back and remove the general waffle after you finish and tidy up the rest. I'm not sure if this would be a good idea though.

### Main body of analysis
	1 point per paragraph!
A series of paragraphs with clear links between them (a justification as to why you are doing this)

Make your analytic claim and introduce them. Give examples and then discuss them. Then when it feels like a good enough point and argument you can conclude it and lead onto the next paragraph.

Then do the next one!

### Conclusion
*Clearly* provide an answer to the question you have been addressing!
- What do these passages have in common and how do they work
- What does your comparison tell us?

This can be fairly brief as you should've been doing this all along!
- It is also a good place to widen your scope to the rest of the novels: what has comparing these passages contributed to our understanding of the novels?
- You are primarily concluding *your analysis **of these passages*** though!
