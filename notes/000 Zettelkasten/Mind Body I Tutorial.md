Descartes' Argument for existence of I
1. Waves of Doubt
2. cogito

Interpretations of the argument of cogito
- Self verifying thought
- Through introspection one can only see properties such as ideas, desires, etc. In D's metaphysics, you can't have properties without a substance to bear them.


Conceivablility

p is conceivable -> p is possible

God or with sets
Sets C and P; C is a subset of P. Seems ok 😁

Bohemia's objection
1. Causal interaction between mind and body (D accepts)
2. Mechanistic view of causation (D accepts)
3. Mind must be extended (D rejects!!)
