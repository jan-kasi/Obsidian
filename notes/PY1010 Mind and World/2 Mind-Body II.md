## Lecture 4: Minds and Brains
1. We live in a physicial world described by laws of physics
	1. This simple idea explains almost everything in the world, or at least we think it does
2. In this world there are also minds.
3. Can these minds be fully explained by physics, using these same terms

Saul Kripke ðŸ˜­

Two fundamentally different views about the mind-body relation.
Suppose a material world, just like ours with respect to the physical facts:

| Position          | Meaning                                                                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Substance Dualism | Some thing (substance) would have to be added to finish creating this world         |
| Property Dualism  | Some properties would have to be added                                              |
| Materialism       | Nothing would have to be added to the material world in order for there to be minds |

### The Identity Theory
Quite simply, whatever is mental is physical.
A number of claims can be made
1. The mind is the brain
2. Consciousness is a brain process (U.T. Place)
3. Pain is a firing of C-fibres
(etc.)

Place: "it is a reasonable scientific hypothesis" that consciousness is a process in the brain, "in the way that the statement 'lightning is a motion of electric charges'". It is "neither self-contradictory nor self-evident".

#### Identity statements
Lightning is an electrical discharge
Water is H2O

Place believes we should believe the same of consciousness is a brain process, pain is a firing of c-fibres, etc.

**Saul Kripke is influential in this**

1. Marylin Monroe is Marlylin Monroe
	1. Obviously, trivially, true just by thinking of it
2. Marylin Monroe is Norma Jeane Mortenson
	1. True, but not obviously. It is a discovery requiring observation
	2. Statements whose confirmation requires observation are referred to as empirical
3. Consider this repeated picture of 2 rabbits (duplicates). Are they identical?
	1. They are qualitatively identical: they are duplicates
		1. Qualitative identity says: there are more than one thing (numerically), but they are described in the same way (like duplicates)
	2. But they are not numerically identical (they can't be because there are two of them)
		1. Numerical identity says: there is one thing, we can call it a or call it b but they're the same ONE thing
4. Leibniz's Law of the Indiscerniblility of Identicals
	1. If a=b, every property that belongs to A belongs to B, and vice versa
	2. More formally, If a=b then for any property F, Fa if and only if Fb
	3. There is also Identity of indiscernibles
5. Reduction
	1. To **reduce** A to B is to give a complete explanation of A in terms of B
	2. The simplest way to do this is to translate the sentences of one theory into sentences of another
	3. The Identity Theory is a reductionist theory. The identity theorist would claim the linguistic difference between pain and c-fibres firing is the same as water and H2O (there would have to be a position told in philosophy of language)

Some arguments for the Identity Theory
- Extensive correlation between mental events and brain events
	- Descartes did not know this, but was interested in it
	- It is now very difficult to maintain the hard Cartesian claims of substance dualism
	- Examples of accidents, brain scans, etc.
	- Also alcohol: it seems that it ought not affect the mind, only the brain
	- There is very strong prima facia evidence for the numerical identity between mind and brain
- No problems for mental causation
- Ockham's razor: William of Ockham c.1285-1347. Not an argument itself, but a methodological principle:
	- "Do not multiply entities beyond necessity"
	- If we can tell the entire story of the mind by explaining it with the brain and the physical, such that we don't NEED mind/substances to explain it, we shouldn't really have any need to include it and it would be better not to. Like a line of invisible pixies that follow you everywhere.

Leibniz' Mill (G.W. Leibniz, Monadology (1714/trans. 1973), P.181)
- Place anticipated this objection by naming it the phenomenological fallacy:
	- Mistaking what you are having an experience of versus the experience itself.
	- Place argues that we tend to conflate the properties of experience with the properties of the thing that is experienced.
	- So when we introspect and think we are experiencing something yellow we are not really experiencing the yellow, rather the thing that is yellow. So there is no need for an experience of yellow to be found in the brain, only the process allowing us to experience the thing that is yellow


## Lecture 5: Functionalism
Thought experiment: changing every part of the brain with artifical matter. Might act and behave in exactly the same way.

Multiple realisation
- The mental is multiply realisable = mental states can be 'realised' by many physically different entities/systems
- If the mental is multiply realisable, this is a big problem for the (type) identity theory
	- How can pain BE a firing of C-fibres, as the Identity Theory claims, if there can be a creature that feels pain but has no C-fibres

### Functionalism

For example, water bottles cannot be properly defined by a single type of physical form as there are many different types of water bottle; it can be described according to how it functions.

According to functionalism, to be in a given mental state is to be in an internal state with the relevant functional role (cf. 'job description').

The functional role of a mental state can be individualised in three components:
1. The typical causes of the internal state
2. The typical effects of the internal state
3. The typical interactions between that internal state and other internal states

A functional role is defined *relative to a* ***system*** - an object that functions as a pendulum in one clock might not function correctly in another
- For a clock to be 'wound-up' means it is in an internal state with the relative functional role where:
1. Typical cause: turning a key
2. Typical effect: The hands move in the correct way
3. Typical interactions: Perhaps something like chimes working correctly

Strictly speaking, functionalism is not commited to materialism.
In practice, functionalists are normally materialists. Because if mental states are just functional roles defined by causal interactions, there seems no reason to have to appeal to some non-physical substance (and deal with all the problems that arise with this)

#### Supervenience
According to standard functionalist theories, mental states supervene on physical states.
Supervenience is a relation of asymmetric dependence.
- The mental supervenes on the physical if, and only if, no two possible individuals are alike physically but differ mentally (but there can be individuals who differ physically without differing mentally (i.e. are alike mentally))

Example of supervenience:
Degree of baldness supervenes on hair distribution
- ...

**Materialism** can be thought of as the view that the mental supervenes on the physical (in the strong sense, such that no two logically possible individuals are exactly alike physically while differing mentally).

At the moment when they are perfectly physically identical, they would be perfectly mentally identical. At any other given moment they may begin to differ (as contemporary view of physics is non-deterministic but rather probabilistic in respect to some things) and then they would not be perfectly mentally identical.

#### Machine Functionalism
Machine Functionalism says that a mind is a certain kind of computer. It makes two claims:
1. Being a computer is a necessary condition for being a mind
	- Nothing could be a mind without being a computer
2. Being an appropriately programmed computer is a sufficient conditionn for being a mind
	- Any appropriately programmed computer is a mind

The multiple realisability of computation
- You can make computers out of many different types of physical *stuff* and in lots of different ways
Hardware/Software distinction captures the difference between our minds and possible other minds.

Some possible objections (even though its more or less the same as a description of standard functionalism)?
1. Who wrote the program
	1. There is no need for intent :p
	2. A possible answer: a combination of nature (through evolutionary mechanisms) and learning
2. But we don't just follow rigid instructions; we do things unexpectedly and we can learn! Can computers do that?
	1. Yeah...
	2. e.g. a computer program can have probabilistic steps
	3. Computers called 'neural networks' can be said to learn, and in some cases do so in a manner that resembles human learning.

#### Types of mental state
1. Consciousness: Qualia (singular: Quale)
2. a
3. a
4. a
5. a

Re-read inverted qualia paper?

The inverted spectrum:
- If the inverted spectrum then functionalism may be false. Because if there is a difference between experiencing something green and something red, this must be a difference between the functional role, and hence a difference in behavious and interactions. Materialism of any kind would be false if two physically identical copies had inverted qualia (but is this possible?).

## Lecture 6: The Knowledge Argument
### Mary's Room Overview
- Frank Jackson (1982) *Epiphenomenal Qualia*. In that he argues that Mary does learn something

Why does it matter?
The truth of physicalism (also called 'materialism').
- Physicalism is the thesis that everything can be described in terms of physics
- There are no non-physical facts
So if you wanted to understand colour experiences, knowing everything about physical facts is enought...

#### A precise argument
1. Mary knows all the physical facts about *experiences* of colour, but has never experienced colour,
2. When Mary experiences red for the first time, she learns something,
3. When one learns something, one encounters a new fact,
	Definition: a fact is something true about the world
4. Mary leans a new fact about red experiences,
5. The new fact Mary learns cannot be a physical fact (she knows all the physical facts *about experiences of colour*).
6. Therefore, there are non-physical facts,
7. Therefore physicalism is false.

#### What is it that Mary learns?
*Mary learns what it's like to experience red.*
- The difference here is because of a difference in "phenomenal character"
- *phenomenal character* of an experience is the *what is it like* to have that experience
	- The expereince's subjective character

**Beware of the term "qualia"**
- Qualia (singular quale) is used to mean many different things
- For PY1010 it is fine to use qualia and phenomenal character interchangeably

### Epiphenomenal Qualia
Jackson (1982) argued the Knowledge Argument shows physicalism is false. He argued instead for epiphenomenal qualia.
Epiphenomenal: something caused by physical events which has no effect on the physical world
- This is a version of property dualism.
Property dualism: the world is composed of physical substance with two distinct kinds of properties.

Jackson (1995) rejecte epiphenomenal qualia because it is impossible to know whether we have such qualia.

### Responses to the Knowledge Argument
1. Ability Hypothesis
2. Mary didn't learn anything
3. Old fact/New knowledge

#### Ability Hypothesis
- Mary did not learn any new facts but gained new abilities
- David Lewis (1988) argues "...knowing what an experience is like just *is* the possession of these abilities to remember, imagine, and recognise" (Lewis 1988, p.55)
- The difference between the 'knowing-that' and the 'knowing-how' (Lewis 1988, p55)

A proposition is expressed by declarative sentences, and are the primary bearers of truth-value

| Knowledge-that                    | Knowledge-how                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Propositional knowledge           | Lewis argues this is distinct from knowledge-that              |
| I know that bikes have two wheels | I know how to ride a bike                                      |
| I know that ripe tomatoes are red | I know how to remember, imagine, and recognise red experiences |

Physicalism remains true because she doesn't learn any new facts

#### Mary didn't learn anything
Daniel Dennet (1991, p.399-401): rather than being released, Mary's captors attempt to fool her by showing her a blue bannana.
What would Mary reply?
- Dennett: "Mary took one look at [the banana] and said..."
- Mary cannot learn anything new, she could figure out what it would be like to experience blue and yellow and the responses she would have to them.
	- This does not mean we cannot learn from physical experiences, only that Mary cannot. Remember that Mary knows even things we don't know, she knows EVERYTHING about the physical facts of colour and experiencing colour, and everything that would require and entail

I am **sad/happy/etc**
I **belive/desire/fear something**
Focusing on this latter part and their place in the world.

Type identity M=P
Mental states simply are physical descriptions, mental states can be reduced to physical states and processes.

Problem of mental realisability?


Functionalism

The functional role defines what a mental state is Mental states are identified with the process and can be described this way.

Definition of pain given by some lower level property.
