# Metaphysics of Race

## 1 Introduction
Baldwin: race as a 'lie'
- Baldwin suggests the idea of whiteness is a 'lie'.
- This could be plausibly understood as a metaphysical claim of:
	1. Race simply doesn't exist, or
	2. Race is not what people think.

### Natural and social kinds
| Natural kind                                         | Social kind               |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Exist independently of human interests and practices | Depend upon our practices |
| e.g. chemical elements, biological species (?)       | e.g. jobs, currencies     |
What about historic kinds?

### Biological realism
**The traditional conception of race**.
- Historically, races have been understood as natural kinds.
- More specifically as biological categories (**biological realism**).
- Associated with **racialism**,
	- > "The view...that there are heritable characteristics, possessed by members of our species, which allow us to divide them into small sets of races[...]" ().
- 
### Eliminitavism

### Reference
- One way to understand this is as a disgreement about the reference of racial terms and concepts.
- When we use words to do with race what are we refferring to?

| Position             | Reference |
| -------------------- | --------- |
| Biological realism   |           |
| Social constructivis |           | 
| Eliminitavism        |           |

We could draw an analogy with scientific concepts:
- *Gold* refers to more or less what we always thought, but scientidic investigation has taught us more about its nature or essence,
- *Planet* refers to something real, but its nature is not what those who introduced the term originally thought,
- *Phlogiston* doesn't refer to anything at all.

### Charles W Mills
> "Whiteness is not really a colour at all, but a set of power relations"

Mills argues that race is socially constructed but nonetheless objective.
- Compare: you are really, objectively students. But 'student' is not a natural kind. People come to be students because of where they fit into certain kinds of social practices.

> "..." ()

- The ways people have traditionally understood race are profoundly flawed: race is not biologically real,
	- For this reason, Mills calls his view **anti-realist**.
- But the ways these …,
	- For this reason, Mills calls his view **objectivist**.


## 2 Continuation
### Revisiting Realism
- **Biological realism** says that there are such groups that are natural biological kinds.
- **Racialism** adds that therse kinds each have distinctive heritable moral, intellectual, and cultural characteristics amounting to racial 'essences'.
	- Closely conncected with racism (Mills 1998, 46).
	- **Also scientifically discredited: there are no such essences**.
- Can we have a form of realism without racialism?
	- We might call this moderate realism.

### Moderate realism
- Non-essentialist biological realism: races are natural biological kinds but these are not associated with distinctive 'essences'.
- The argument *against* biological realism is, briefly, that the concept of race plays no important role in the best theories in biological anthropology.
- The biological realist would have to identify something in such theories that corresponds well enough to the ordinary concept of race that it’s a plausible referent for racial terms.

1. One view: races are '(groups of) ancestor-descendent sequences of breeding polulations that share a common origin.' These are **subspecies** of *Homo sapiens*, given a **cladistic approach** to subspecies (Andreasen  1998)
	- A cladistic approach would categorise people based on shared descent rather than intrinsic racial characteristics.

### Doubts about Moderate Realism
- Does this give us what we want from an account of race (as metaphysicians)?
	- The cladistic approach doesn’t seem to say **anything** about racial hierarchies or power relations,
	- Recall Haslanger’s 'ameliorative' approach to metaphysics: '…the task is to develop accounts of gender and race that will be effective tools in the fight against injustice' (Haslanger 2000, 36).
	- Moderate realism doesn't seem to help us much here
- The cladistic races don't map well onto ways people are **racialised**.
	- e.g. There's no single group corresponding to 'Asian' (even in the American sense that typically excludes South Asians).
- There needen't be any correlation between cladistic race and morphology/appearance.
	- So it’s not clear that the cladistic approach can provide suitable **referents** for ordinary racial terms.
- There is further reading about this, Andreasen is not the only approach

### Eliminitavism
1. 'Race' concepts were originally intended as concepts of biological categories,
2. If we can't find genuine biological categories that correspond to them, a natural response is to say that these concepts are bankrupt.
- Racial terms are like 'witch'
	- They always mischaracterise the people to whom they are applied, often with harmful consequences.
	- We should therefore eliminate race terms from our discourse. They are empty, misleading, false. ‘Race’ is a lie.

The leading proponents of eliminitavism are Kwame Anthony Appiah and Naomi Zach.
1. Zach
	1. Race concepts are 'a rememnant of archaic science'.
> ‘Essences, geography, phenotypes, genotypes, and genealogy are the only known candidates for physical scientific bases of race. Each fails. Therefore, there is no physical scientific basis for the social racial taxonomy’ (Zack 2002, 88).

2. Appiah broadly agrees but he thinks we still need a concept of **racial identity**
	1. These are **social identities**, which we have because we attribute racial labels to ourselves and others, and because we can identify with them.
	2. They have a historical association with a *presumed* racial essence.
	3. Even though such essences don't exist, the associated identities attain a social reality as 'scripts' we use in living our lives.
	4. Even if positive, these identities can constrain individual autonomy

### The reality of race?
- Eliminativism, like moderate realism, seems problematic from an ameliorative perspective.
	- If we eliminate racial concepts, we seem to eliminate the resources we need to analyse and confront racial injustice.
- Conceptual resources can have great political significance. Consider, e.g., the concept of sexual harassment.
	- But that concept was so significant because it enabled us to identify genuine facts that already obtained! Can we say the same for ‘'race'?

- Mills argues that we can, eliminativism is not just politically inexpedient but misguided metaphysically.
	- It ignores facts about the **experience** of racialised people and **social facts** about racial oppression.
- Consider: facts about race seem to be implicated in explaining things that happen to people in the context of racism and racial oppression.
	- e.g. Black women in the US are more likely to die in pregnancy and childbirth. Race seems to be causally relevant to life-and-death outcomes.	
- The eliminativist might respond that what’s doing the work here are people’s beliefs and attitudes about race, not race itself.
	- But can we really separate these so neatly? Not according to social constructivism.
	- The eliminitavist response only works if for race to be real it *has* to be biological.
