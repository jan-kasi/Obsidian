# Preparatory Questions
1. Find an interesting motif (symbol, image, object) in Madame Bovary and give page numbers for where it occurs. Briefly explain what you think its function is and how it relates to the themes of the novel.
Motif of the Church and its various parts. For example, one of the first things we learn of Emma's background, about Emma as a person rather than the object of Charles' admiration, is that she was 'brought up at the Ursuline Convent, had received what is called "a good education"' (page 18). There is an irony between what Madame Dubac thinks charms Charles and what Flaubert's use of the free indirect indicates that Charles sees Emma as. Dubac hears of her proper religious upbringing and knowing "dancing, geography, drawing, how to embroider and play the piano", which is suggested Madame Dubac did not receive and thus finds it "the last straw" as showing her inadequacy of upbringing and class (despite Emma being a farmer's daughter) represented by an almost innocent quality of someone raised in the Church's institutes. Flaubert represents Emma through Charles' perception as something quite opposed to the virtues the Church would aim to produce, Emma is to Charles an object of sensuousness as was explored in the lectures.

Another instance of the Church in Part I is the priest declining a drink and the subsequent exchange between the landlady and pharmacist the evening before the Bovarys were to arrive at Yonville (pages 65-66) where there is a sense that the priest declines not out of a personal duty but rather convention. This is raised explicitly by the pharmacist when he calls it "the most odious hypocrisy; all priests tippled on the sly" and perhaps therefore implicitly his polite declining because "he had come for his umbrella" and needs to leave for the church, rather than that he does not drink because he is a priest. The Landlady's defence is also interesting in that she defends neither the religion nor the priest, but rather compliments his strength.

In Part II Emma's relapse into the church is shown as a social reaction to try and ease her conscience. The church in this way is portrayed as something which is not done purely for the individual but rather for the society the individual is in; that attending church regularly is part of the functional description of being "a good housewife", rather than something correct for its sake as religion or truth (page 88). Then when she becomes distressed by Berthe in Part II, she immediately before is confronted by the unanswered question of what a Christian is (page 95).

After Emma's death, Charles attempts to find relief in the Church almost as routine, only for this to be innefective and disturbed by the macabre with his visions of Emma and the nature of his uncanny death.

In this sense, the motif of the church seems to portray it as innefective upon the individual, but effective on society. And that the church serves as a means of escape and comfort in society rather than in the individual.

2. Famously, Flaubert uses a shifting and at times elusive narrative perspective in the novel. Find a moment in the novel that you find interesting in its use of the narrative voice and briefly explain what you think its effects are. Try to choose an example not mentioned in the lectures.

> ''"Weren't you happy? Is it my fault? But I did the best I could!"  
''"Yes, that's true . . . you're good, not like the others."  
'And she slowly passed her hand over his hair. The sweetness of  
this sensation deepened his sadness; he felt his whole being dissolving in despair at the though that he must lose her, just when  
she was confessing more love for him than she ever did. He didn't  
know what to do, felt paralyzed by fear; the need for an immediate  
decision took away his last bit of self-control.  
'Emma thought that, at last, she was through with lying, cheating  
and with the numberless desires that had tortured her. She hated  
no one now; a twilight dimness was settling upon her thoughts, and, of all earthly noises, Emma heard none but the intermittent  
lamentations of this poor heart, sweet and remote like the echo of  
a symphony dying away.'

I find it interesting how Flaubert quickly switches from Charles and Emma's direct speech, which reveal their surface emotions, and then to a free indirect with Charles as the focaliser in the first paragraph and Emma as the focaliser in the second. This is also a point of importance between Charles and Emma, where they both reveal through speech and influence over the narrator what they feel and have felt. Also, because the blurring of character and narrator blurs even more in this small extract, the division of where reality truly is becomes more confusing. For example, it is not clear whether these are truly their thoughts or it is the situation which calls for this response.


3. Do you think that Madame Bovary deserves to be called a ‘novel of adultery’? Briefly justify your answer, bearing in mind the conventions of the genre that were introduced last week.
At a superficial level I think the novel could be classified as a novel of adultery where adultery is the main focus and driving force behind the succession of events, and even at a more critical level the novel has much to say about adultery and everything surrounding it. But I think it could also be classified more specifically as a turning point for the novel of adultery in the 19th century; as *Madame Bovary* could be said to challenge what the novel of adultery was at the time. This is shown most clearly outside the text by the famous trial against the novel for offence against public morality and religion. Within the text it is clear by the Realism which Flaubert uses, and in his letters how he writes that he wishes to write something where the author's personality is absent and he does not express his emotions or opinions,  rather than a more moralised style which would have been convention. The use of the free indirect to blur the omniscient narrative voice and character's personal realities helps to do this, as does the continuation of the story after Emma's death. For this reason, it is both a novel of adultery and a challenge to Flaubert's contemporary canon of the novel of adultery.

19th century novels often used symbolism in the style, some more heavily than others.
