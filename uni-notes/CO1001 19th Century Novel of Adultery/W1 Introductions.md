# L2 Why compare 19th Century European Novels?

Translation is the means by which literature is made accesible for Comparison. <- for this reason it is a key focus of Comp Lit.

By translation, text does not remain fixed. Translation is often tied to marketing.

The Canon.
There are works and writers who become cannonical. The members of the canon can become a canonical theme or genre over and above the text itself. E.g. Charles Dickens (writer), the 'Dickensian' (style/theme/concept), 1984 (work).

**Why read 19th Century European Novels?** (we ought to be suspicious of these, but charitable in some ways too)
- Documents providing historical information
- Relationship to the author's biography and intentions
- Relating to the human condition (Lecturer thinks we ought to be incredibly suspicious of this because this would tend to bring a certain homogeneity and interpretation of a particular view point as a universal when it may not be so)
- Relating to specific cultures
- Literature as a kind of writing different from other discourses. The Novel is beginning to become the dominant form during 19th century.

1. Historical Information INSERT CITATIONS FROM SLIDES
	1. The books are often considers as providing a glimpse into a past era which is no longer accesible to us, and in the form of the novel is accesible in a different way and offers other things.
	2. The novel is not simply a story but a method of capture and preservation of that historical moment and mood
2. Biography and intentions 
	1. Flaubert's famous quote "Madame Bovary, c'est moi" -- we can understand the authors themselves through their novels
	2. We can understand values and beliefs the author holds in reading the novels
	3. Narrator and Author are distinct beings
	4. In Anna Kareneina author's mouthpiece generally accepted to be Levin (key: the mouthpiece is a character, NOT the narrator!)
	5. Knowledge of the author might help us to adopt a critical understanding of a novel, rather than the other way around
3. Human Universals?
	1. There is nothing universal about the opinions and perspectives of the authors, or of the protagonists and characters!
	2. That said, there seems something within this fascinating which appeals to many people (or we think does...)
	3. Perhaps something about the lived expereinced is reflective of our own even though the particulars of the experience and situation may be different.
	4. The 19th century as a turning point where people's social experience accelerates and changes dramatically. The experience of time and distance has changed with modernity.
	5. The power of imagination is not exclusive to 19th Century rural England, for the example of Dickens' *Hard Times*
4. Cultural Specificity
	1. Fernando Poyatos (an anthropologists) suggests that "the study of people and their cultural manifestations through their national literatures - without doubt the richest source of documentation..."
	2. In House of Ulloa Barzan "sets out to portray the world in her ficiton as accurately and truthfully as possible" (cite)
	3. A.S. Byatt (2002). "All novels create characters and worlds which are both particular and typical. The nineteenth-century realist novel is at the crossroads between two kinds of 'type'..."
5. **Reading Literature as a specific kind of writing**
	1. A kind of writing that is distinctly different form historical and other kinds of writing
	2. What makes literature special and what is most worth spending time on, in not so much WHAT is said but HOW...
	3. Narration: how are the stories told to us?
		- who speaks (narrative voice)?
		- who's vision is presented (focalisation, who is the focaliser at a given time)?
		- How are speech and thoughts represented?
		- How does this limit the reader's knowledge?
		- What is the relationship between descriptions and events? Who is describing, and what? This has many structural implicaitons...
		- Descriptions and Desire
			- We see the role of desire in an increasingly disenchanted world and the transferral of desire/s to fictional, alternative dimensions (reading, dreaming, planning)

ekphrasis: the description of one work of art within an other

**The Novel and its possibilities.**
Example:
> But when she saw herself in the mirror she wondered at her face. Never had her eyes been so large, so black, nor so deep. ... A blue space surrounded her and ordinary existence appeared only intermittently between these heights, dark and far away beneath her.
- omniscient third-person narrator
- internal focalisation (Emma becomes the focaliser)
- Short moments of direct speech:
- Free indirect style
	- So at last she was to know
	-> **Combines the character's voive with the narrative voice**

This leaves us unsure of the boundary of where the narrator and the person ends, and by extension where I end etc...

"Free indirect style is a sort of stylistic Panopticon, where the narrator's master voice [...] continually needs to confirm its authority by qualifyig, cancelling, endorsinf, subsuming all..."
