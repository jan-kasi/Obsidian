## Lecture 1: Origins of the Problem
-- Antonio (Tony) Salgado Borge; absb1

**Jaegwon Kim**: mind-body problem is rather a cluster of problems:
1. The problem of mental causation
2. The problem of consciousness

**Tradition** In the history of Western Philosophy the problem of mental causation was not particularly considered.
Scholastic Philosophy (example):

Mind and body are conceptually connected.

- Tradition did not consider Prime Matter to be active but rather passive and unstructured. It is simply the stuff that makes the thing. Matter is not different between bodies, what makes one body makes another.
- The Form of something is what that thing is, it is an active organizational principle. Form can be understood as the soul which works as the informant towards animation of the body to make it a thing.

To be a Form is to be able to inform matter.

Prime matter and form are conceptually and physically connected. Most philosophers thought one cannot have prime matter without a form or a form without prime matter.

**Descartes**
Mind and body are conceptually independent!!!! Distinct.

### Conceptual independence

#### Step 1: I cannot be certain that I am Material

IT IS PRUDENT NEVER TO TRUST COMPLETELY THOSE WHO HAVE DECEIVED US EVEN ONCE :DDDDD

Meditation 1 basically establishes that I cannot be certain the material world exists (Med6).

Waves of Doubt:
Wave 1: I cannot trust my sensate experiences
Wave 2: I cannot be sure that I am not dreaming
Wave 3: Painter's analogy ()
Wave 4: Deceiving God Hypothesis (nuanced but basically discount Wave 3 counterargument, until later in the Meditations). Alternatively Evil Deceiver but further nuance to this aaauuuugh. 
Wave 5: Defective Origins Hypothesis

#### Step 2: I can be certain that *I am, I exist* as *res cogitans*.
John Cottingham's interpretations of cogito are useful here.

Better to go with Kant or Papa Cottingham's interpretation. "Ooga booga i am deceived so i exist, you can't deceive the nonexistent" lacks some nuance to what Descartes' argument is.

2.2 Clarification of what mental states are.
Mental states pressupose Thought.

IN ORDER TO SKIP this weird 2 step process simply understand the cogito as a cognitive act of existence. This makes more sence with the Meditations as a whole in mind (to discount Evil Deceiver and establish clarity of mind to prove further on that corporeal material reality exists), otherwise you have to do further steps which seem ad hoc.

Of course it makes more sense to understand this as 2 steps for understanding of the idea for separation of mind and body as conceptually independent (distinct substances). Otherwise thought and body become one substance or linked in some non distinct way (thought is distinct but modes of thoughts and mental states would pressupose body/thought rests on body rather than being distinct).

First you have to accept Descartes' interpretation of what certainty is...

Russel's Objection: not that i am thought but that thought is.

#### Step 3: Independent existence
Having demonstrated conceptual independence of mind and body, Descartes wishes to demonstrate their independent existence as formal reality.

Achieved through his Substance Theory.

Levels and flow of reality.

Platonists be shaking in their graves when my guy Tony said "We do not have properties floating around", where is the FORM of FLUFF? NOOOOOO :despair:

Thought is a substance. It is not a nonessential property. USING THE COGITO: thought does not depend on a body (A controversial position, Descartes! But your position nontheless)

Wax argument: but use of language.

Extention> "the subject matter of pure mathematics" Meditation 6.

Mind is a substance (thought). < A pure mind is not a human mind (introduction and synopsis). Cottingham argues succesfully that human existence is (for Descartes) a mixture of mind and body such that they are intimately linked and entangled (but the problem then arrives with interaction problem). This makes sense for confused perceptions too.

| Mind                                                      | Body                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Nonesential: concepts, imagination, desires               | Nonessential: shape, size, hardness, location, motion               |
| Essence: thought                                          | Essence: Extension                                                  |
| Substance: Mind (The IDEAL "I"; or simply a res cogitans) | Substance: Body (or an extendede thing, ideally THE extended thing) |

Descartes' argument for thought being independent of a body (eg a brain) is due to his definition of certainty and his method chosen. It is linked to the tradition he inherits too.
However, he believes that the mind resides in the brain (specifically pineal gland but ignore that lol...), and that they interact in some way.

## Lecture 2: Substance Dualism
1. Separation Thesis
	1. Meditation 2: Thought and Extension are conceptually independent
	2. He is yet to show that they exist as distict substances. He achieves this in Meditation 6 (different to the existence of material external reality!).
2. Meditation 6: Conceivability argument
	1. Idea of body and mind are both CDIs (explained in Principles of Philosophy)
		1. Clarity: 
		2. Distinct: not confused, can be separated 
	2. When we have a clear and distinct idea of something we know the *essence* of that thing,  (what makes it the case that the thing is *itself* or explains why it is itself)
	3. Truth for ideas: the idea (within the mind) corresponds to external material reality/formal reality.
		1. CDP rule for veracity: see SEP Descartes' Epistemology article (i think its this one) or see Essay 25
	4. We have one CDI for my essence (thought) and another CDI for the essence of my body (extension), therefore being CDIs, these ideas represent the true states of the world.
	5. They are capable of being separated at least by God (but this does not mean that they are currently separated). IF x is conceivable, x is possible (see Kripke or Chalmers?).
	6. Therefore Thought and Extension must be able to exist as distinct things (a mind and body).

(1) I can conceive Thought without Extension,
(2) If x is conceivable, x is possible,
(3) Thought and Extension must be able to exist as distinct things (a mind and a body).

Objections:
1. Descartes extrapolates from material experience (even though he tries not to) towards the immaterial inexperienced which is apparently experiened without the body yet through the body.
2. Does not explain further (an ok objection)
3. Problem of interaction
4. Just God
5. Underlying rationalist v materialist argument
6. Descartes must demonstrate that from the possibility of distinctness, distinctness is true in formal reality.
7. Just show that Premise (1) is false, that one cannot conceive Thought without Extension; because step (2) DEPENDS on (1).

Replies
1.  Necessity of Identity Principle. Evidence in Text "Not even God could make one human different from herself" seems to suggest D accepts something along the lines of Necessity of Identity Principle.
	1. (\forall Ox and \forall Oy -> x=y)
	2. for every object x and object y, if x and y are the same object it is necessary that x and y are the same object. Reflexive identity: objects are necessarily identical to themselves.
	3. THEREFORE
		1. It is possible that thought and extension are distinct
		2. Identity is necessary (Necessity of Identity Principle)
		3. Mind and Body cannot be numerically identical (By 1 and 3). Numerical identity is used as Existence modifier(teminology?)
2. Law of Indiscernibles


Objection for rejecting step (1)
From the argument that
(1) I can doubt that I am extension
(2) I cannot doubt that I am Thought
it does not follow that
(3) Extension cannot be Thought
Perhaps I am just ignorant of the identity of thought and extension etc. (or masked man fallacy)


Of course, Descartes' argument for the Clarity of Mind could be linked as a reply.
Descartes' own reply to this objection when raised to him is that there is no link whatsoever which can be formed between them. The argument is rather of the form:
(1) I can doubt that I am extension
(2) I cannot doubt that I am Thought
(3) There are no similarities between extension and Thought
(4) Extension cannot be thought
Or just (3)->(4)

Objection for God:
What if one rejects God as a premise?
Descartes' reply: "The question of what kind of power is required...does not affect the judgement". Descartes anticipates philosophers today who thing that that which involves no logical contradition is possible (can be brought about by nature).


2D semantics for Chalmers used in conceivability argument with PZ.


3. Divisibility Argument:
(1) A body is divisible,
(2) The mind is indivisible,
(3) One and the Same thing cannot have contradictory properties at the same time,
(4) Divisibility and Indivisibility are contradictory properties (they are basically negations of each other),
(5) Therefore mind and body cannot be noe and the same thing.

Most emipirical evidence suggests that body *is* divisible.
Descartes' reply to division of mind into distinct thoughts is that these are all modes of thought, thought itself does not have parts.


Summary:
Thought and Extension are conceptually independent
Two arguments for premise that mind and body can exist independently as distinct substances (conceivability and divisibility)


## Lecture 3: Mind-Body Problem
D: Mind and Body are two numerically distinct things (they exist as two distinct things in the world).

We will look at three objections
1. Spatiality Problem
2. Interaction Problem
3. Causal Overdetermination Problem

Meditation 6 CSM II p56 "There is nothing that my own nature teaches me more vividly than that I have a body, and that when I feel pain [...] and so on"
There seems a pairing of mind and body for humans.
- Ship analogy: if I were not a mind intermingled with the body, I would not **feel** pain but simply perceive it by the intellect (process).
- The mind is affected by states of the body
- The mind is not simply a passanger of the body (not just a homunculus)

The Nature of the Union of mind and body
- There is some part of the brain where intermingling between mind and body takes place
- Descartes posits this part of the brain is able to **communicate** with the mind by sending some signals
- Descartes holds that there is empirical evidence of this (with our current empirical evidence, we hold it isn't the pineal gland but this does not matter; the main point is that there is some part of the brain which intermingles with the mind)
### 1. Spatiality Problem
**Margaret Cavendish (1623-1673)**
> I would ask those, that say the Brain has neither sense, reason, nor self-motion, and therefore no Perception; but that all proceeds from an Immaterial Principle, as an Incorporeal Spirit, distinct from the body, which moveth and actuates corporeal matter; I would fain ask them, I say, where their Immaterial Ideas reside, in what part or place of the Body? and whether they be little or great?

> If [the mind is] immaterial…having no dimension nor divisibility of parts…how can it be confined in a material body?

(1) Location and movement belongs only to material (extended) things,
(2) My mind moves and is located wherever my body is,
And from this we can derive that if the mind moves with the body,
(3) My mind must be material (it cannot be immaterial)

Possible replies:
1. A brute fact?
	1. This is a problematic move especially for a rationalist (principle of sufficient reason/explanation). Also his own version of brute facts are very selective, and I don't particularly see how they could integrate this premise without it being a different ad hoc kind of brute fact
2. God's Will?
	1. We would need to show that God exists, that God has a Will, and that God has reason to Will this.

### 2. Interaction Problem 
**Elizabeth of Bohemia** 
How can the mind affect the body to bring about voluntary actions?

**Step 1**
1. It seems that how a thing moves depends solely on
	1. how much is pushed
	2. the manner in which it is pushed, or
	3. the surface-texture and shape of the thing that pushes it
	1 and 2 pressupose contact, hence extension. 3 pressuposes the acausally active thing be extended.

1. For x to move a body y it is necessary that x and y are extended

**Step 2**
(2) “Your notion of the soul [the mind] entirely excludes extension, and it appears to me that an immaterial thing can’t possibly touch anything else (Elisabeth of Bohemia, 6.v.1643).”

The mind cannot have the property of extension.
2. The mind is not extended

**Conclusion**
1. For x to move a body y, it is necessary that x and y are extended
2. The mind is not extended
3. The mind cannot move the body

**Descartes' unconvincing (?) reply**

--
Notions about the soul and body
Confusions
Different powers

**Elizabeth's reply**

-- 
From the premise that the force is not a substance to move the body but rather a secondary quality of a body, hence a body moving a body. It does not follow that hence the soul may move a body by a different power/quality. This is simply attributing the something not-knowin to the mind.
Elizabeth of Bohemia finds it far easier (more correct/less wishywashy) to claim extension of the mind/soul than to allow the immaterial material influence.

### 3. Causal Overdetermination
**Jaegwon Kim**
1. "Physics is causally and explanatory self-sufficient: there is no need to go outside the physical domain to find a cause, or a causal explanation, of a physical event" (Jaegwon Kim, Physicalism or Something Near Enough, pp.16-7)
		1. **Principle of causal closure**
		2. Every event in the physical domain is sufficiently explained within the physical domain/has a sufficiently physical cause
2. "If an event e has a sufficient cause c at t, no event at t distinct from c can be the cause of e" (Jaegwon Kim, Physicalism or Something Near Enough, pp.16-7)
		1. **Principle of causal exclusion**
		2. One event cannot have more than one sufficient cause at the same time
3. No event in the physical domain can have a sufficient mental cause


### Replies
1. Occasionalism: God is the only true cause
	1. "As I understand it, a true cause is one in which the mind perceives a necessary connection between the cause and its effect. Now, it is only in an infinitely perfect being that one perceives a necessary connection between its will and its effects. Thus God is the only true cause, and only He truly has the power to move bodies” (The Search after Truth, p.446)
	2. Mind and Body are both **Causally Inept**, only God has causal power
	3. There is no interaction between substances
	4. God permamently intervenes

2. Pre-established Harmony
	1. Leibniz: "Each created substance is programmed at creation such that all its natural states and actions are carried out in conformity with all the natural states and actions of every other created substance” (Kulstad and Carlin, SEP)
	2. No interaction between substances
	3. God has established the co-relation between mind and body from the beginning
	4. God only intervenes at creation (this corresponds to SEP article thinker's view on cartesian creation).

Descartes' Argument for existence of I
1. Waves of Doubt
2. cogito

Interpretations of the argument of cogito
- Self verifying thought
- Through introspection one can only see properties such as ideas, desires, etc. In D's metaphysics, you can't have properties without a substance to bear them.


Conceivablility

p is conceivable -> p is possible

God or with sets
Sets C and P; C is a subset of P. Seems ok 😁

Bohemia's objection
1. Causal interaction between mind and body (D accepts)
2. Mechanistic view of causation (D accepts)
3. Mind must be extended (D rejects!!)
