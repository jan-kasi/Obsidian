# Week 2: Mind-Body Problem II
## Lecture 4: Minds and Brains
1. We live in a physicial world described by laws of physics
	1. This simple idea explains almost everything in the world, or at least we think it does
2. In this world there are also minds.
3. Can these minds be fully explained by physics, using these same terms

Saul Kripke ðŸ˜­

Two fundamentally different views about the mind-body relation.
Suppose a material world, just like ours with respect to the physical facts:
| Position          | Add?                                                                                |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Substance Dualism | Some thing (substance) would have to be added to finish creating this world         |
| Property Dualism  | Some properties would have to be added                                              |
| Materialism       | Nothing would have to be added to the material world in order for there to be minds |

### The Identity Theory
Quite simply, whatever is mental is physical.
A number of claims can be made
1. The mind is the brain
2. Consciousness is a brain process (U.T. Place)
3. Pain is a firing of C-fibres
(etc.)

Place: "it is a reasonable scientific hypothesis" that consciousness is a process in the brain, "in the way that the statement 'lightning is a motion of electric charges'". It is "neither self-contradictory nor self-evident".

#### Identity statements
Lightning is an electrical discharge
Water is H2O

Place believes we should believe the same of consciousness is a brain process, pain is a firing of c-fibres, etc.

**Saul Kripke is influential in this**

1. Marylin Monroe is Marlylin Monroe
	1. Obviously, trivially, true just by thinking of it
2. Marylin Monroe is Norma Jeane Mortenson
	1. True, but not obviously. It is a discovery requiring observation
	2. Statements whose confirmation requires observation are referred to as empirical
3. Consider this repeated picture of 2 rabbits (duplicates). Are they identical?
	1. They are qualitatively identical: they are duplicates
		1. Qualitative identity says: there are more than one thing (numerically), but they are described in the same way (like duplicates)
	2. But they are not numerically identical (they can't be because there are two of them)
		1. Numerical identity says: there is one thing, we can call it a or call it b but they're the same ONE thing
4. Leibniz's Law of the Indiscerniblility of Identicals
	1. If a=b, every property that belongs to A belongs to B, and vice versa
	2. More formally, If a=b then for any property F, Fa if and only if Fb
	3. There is also Identity of indiscernibles
5. Reduction
	1. To **reduce** A to B is to give a complete explanation of A in terms of B
	2. The simplest way to do this is to translate the sentences of one theory into sentences of another
	3. The Identity Theory is a reductionist theory. The identity theorist would claim the linguistic difference between pain and c-fibres firing is the same as water and H2O (there would have to be a position told in philosophy of language)

Some arguments for the Identity Theory
- Extensive correlation between mental events and brain events
	- Descartes did not know this, but was interested in it
	- It is now very difficult to maintain the hard Cartesian claims of substance dualism
	- Examples of accidents, brain scans, etc.
	- Also alcohol: it seems that it ought not affect the mind, only the brain
	- There is very strong prima facia evidence for the numerical identity between mind and brain
- No problems for mental causation
- Ockham's razor: William of Ockham c.1285-1347. Not an argument itself, but a methodological principle:
	- "Do not multiply entities beyond necessity"
	- If we can tell the entire story of the mind by explaining it with the brain and the physical, such that we don't NEED mind/substances to explain it, we shouldn't really have any need to include it and it would be better not to. Like a line of invisible pixies that follow you everywhere.

Leibniz' Mill (G.W. Leibniz, Monadology (1714/trans. 1973), P.181)
- Place anticipated this objection by naming it the phenomenological fallacy:
	- Mistaking what you are having an experience of versus the experience itself.
	- Place argues that we tend to conflate the properties of experience with the properties of the thing that is experienced.
	- So when we introspect and think we are experiencing something yellow we are not really experiencing the yellow, rather the thing that is yellow. So there is no need for an experience of yellow to be found in the brain, only the process allowing us to experience the thing that is yellow
