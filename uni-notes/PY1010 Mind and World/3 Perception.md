## Lectures
### 1 Realism
- Perceptual realism: the objects we perceive exist and the properties we percieve them as having don't depend on being perceived
- The argument from illusion/hallucination for indirect realism

Naïve realism
- 

Scientific Realism about perception
- Consider how different species are sensitive to different distinctions in colour (for example goldfish have four types of cones in their retinas)
- It seems hard to say that we are seeing colours correctly and goldfish aren't, or vice-versa
- The scientific realist says that features like colour are in part a product of our mind
	- This is still a type of realism since not all features we perceive are like this

Locke's distinction between Primary and Secondary qualities
- What we are directly aware fo are sense data
- Our ideas about primary qualitites, resemble the actual qualitities; our ideas of secondary qualities don't
- Inverted spectrum thought experiment

### 2 Anti-realism
Berkely's Idealism

Berekely agreed that secondary qualities are products of our mind but denied that primary qualities were any different.
Analogy of size for different insects. A tiny pebble for a human would be large for a tiny insect (mite) and for even a smaller insect be a mountain. Size, for Berekely, is invertible.

## Tutorial
Realist/anti-realist about X or Y; not just realist/anti-realist in general.
Does X exist, is X min-independent?

Perception is one prima face justification for naïve realism.

For this reason, and others, historically if you want to attack realism about material objects you go through realism about objects of perception.

1. Sometimes we see/taste/touch something that is F, although there is no mind-independent object that is F,
2. Whenever we see/taste/touch something F, there is an object of our perception that is F,
	1. One way to challenge this is that this claim pre-supposes a relational view of perception; you can also propose a representational view of perception.
	2. ![[Drawing 2022-10-04 09.40.20.excalidraw]]
3. Therefore, in hallucinations there are mind-dependent objects of perception.

Next steps:

4. Hallucinations and veridical experiences are subjectively indistinguishable,
	1. Quite easy to? Pre-supposes that there are material things/objects of perception.
5. If two perceptual experiences are subjectively indistinguishable, then they have the same structure,
	1. Propose a proper thesis of supervenience of the feeling upon the structure (same structure -> same feeling);
		1. . This suggests that two things feel the same therefore they have the same structure; you should rather suggest that there is one structure and therefore one feeling. It looks similar but one is false and one is correct.
	2. Disjunctivism ![[Drawing 2022-10-04 09.48.00.excalidraw]]
6. Therefore, in both hallucinataions and veridical experiences the objects of perception are mind-dependent.

Locke doesn't say that the mind-dependent idea is red/sour/soft. (? maybe that we perceive it as red/sour/soft, because of its mind-independent primary qualities, but it is not in itself red/sour/soft and the IDEA/PERCEPTION itself is not red/sour/soft either (windmill argument similarity?))
