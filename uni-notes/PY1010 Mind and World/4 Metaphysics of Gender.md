| Term                                             | Meaning                                                                            |

| Essentialism                                     | There is some property/ies that all and only the gender kind women share           |
| Biological essentialism                          | x is a woman iff x has biological property B                                       |
| Social essentialism (classificatory in Mikkola ) | x is a woman iff x has some social property S (some people add, on the basis of B) |
| Anti-essentialism                                | There is no feature/s that all and only the gender kind women share                |
|                                                  |                                                                                    |

If you add "on the basis of B" they are extensionally identical but not in the essence.

Arument from intersectionality against social essentialism:
1. Many properties determine your social position,
2. No two women have the same social position,
3. Therefore social (classificatory) essentialism is false.


red car = red + (and a) car
small cat = small for a cat (not being small and a cat; there is a difference between the small in moose and cat and car, etc.)

Disjuctive anti-essentialism (biologcal essentialism + an "or ..." becomes anti-essentialist)

Tutor: Butler says they are an anti-essentialist but you can extract an essentialist view from them.
- x is a woman iff x habitually peforms the woman-role (this is not what Butler says! But you *can* extract this from them).


Haslanger is more trying to create a category for useful political purposes.
