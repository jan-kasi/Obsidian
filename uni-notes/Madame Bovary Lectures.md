## ?
Why did Flaubert write this novel?
- Is it a profanation of the sacred?
- Or a sacralisation of the profane?

"The lyric legion of these adulteruos women"
- She is happy not because of her lover but by the having of a lover

"So beautiful in books"
- Real love was around her all the time in the figure of her father's love for her mother
	- Pure, sacrificial, timeless
- At the end discovers the love for her

## Defining adultery
The word adultery:
Part 1: nothing

Part 2:
- 'Domestic mediocrity drove her to lews fancies, marriage...'
At the end of part 2 there is the dissilution of adultery; the same dissapointment with marriage in part 1 occurs with adultery in part 2.
Part 3:
Adultery openly compared to poison.

An ominous ride. Part 1 Ch IX.
Ominous
Erotic
Sad and bleak atmosphere (October)

Discrepancy between how Emma feels and the banality of what has happened.
Adultery is a huge matter in how it affects an individual, it does not need to be some influential figure.

## Aspects of Emma's adultery
### A premonitory wedding
Spending issue. No excitement for the marriage (Emma). Emma is not fulfilled.

### Sensuality
- Senses: touch. Silk, velvet.
- Bourgeois comfort: 
- Voluptuousnes: she is described as voluptuous in how she moves, how she looks, and how she dresses. We see her as the object and subject of sensuality.
- Damnation: wants to be interesting through damnation. Flaubert contemporary to *Flowers of Evil*
### Melancholy
- Isolation
- Boredom
- Desire for desire
- Depression?
She feels empty and trapped in her life. She does not desire her parteners, she desires the passion and desire (the wish to feel something). 

**Bovarysm** (Like 'Don Quixotism')
A desire to escape from one's conditions through luxury, travels, windows, religion, novels, marriage, lovers, and maybe death.

## Emma's Death
Why is Emma's death described the way it is? Why is it so long and detailed?

Convention of the genre, perhaps, the adulterous woman must die.
- Flaubert adds some twist to this
	- Does she die simply just because she was adulterous?
	- Greed or Lust?
	- Flaubert is using a voice of "The author as God", the author is everywhere but is absent. Flaubert is refusing the conventional use of the author as God the moraliser. Space is left for sympathy.
		- Reason for some of the controversy, not only does Flaubert write something seen as perverse, he does not provide some sort of moral condemnation but leaves the reader to decide!

Remember, this is not the end of the novel!
There are a few more pages about the others.
There is no social nor divine justice at the end of the novel.

## The Setting
Emma is torn between the "Here" that she despises and rejects and the "There" which she dreams of but cannot reach (she is a woman)

The Stucture!
- 'Plot' vs 'Story'
	- Plot: order in which events happen to characters
	- Story: order in which events are told to readers
- Traditional Sturcture
	- Chronological progression
	- Circle of life (realism) = no escape
	- Closed ending = no escape!
- Parallel structure
	- Repetitions, mirror effect, eternal return of the same = no escape

### The Here
### The There
