# How should we treat non-human animals?
Lecture by Joel Joseph

## Terminology
1. A being has a *moral status* if it matters morally *in its own right*
	- On some views there is only one moral status (unitarian), in others they come in degrees (hierarchical).
	- FMS (full moral status) used to count whatever is required to fulfil any moral status category needed
2. Humans and Persons
	- Human being: biological member of group *Homo sapiens*
	- Person: a being with sophisticated psychological capacities akin to an adult human
	- There can be non-human persons and non-person humans
## Moral Status of Animals
Most of us believe we are morally justified simply by taste: it is okay to raise and kill animals (even in painful ways) even if unnecesary, just because they taste good 
By contast, doing the same to any of *us* seems wrong
This similar judgement applies to other areas such as animal experimentation, clothing, etc.

We must find some morally relevant difference between us and those animals to justify this moral asymmetry; or a moral system.
### Speciesism
The view that membership of a specific biological group is a morally significant property *per se*.
- We are permitted to discount interests of other animals simply because they are not human, for example.

### Singer against Speceisism
Most people agree that certain forms of discrimination are wrong (even if they do nothing about it or accept it)
**Principle of Equal Consideration of Interests**
- the interests of every being affected by an action ought to be taken into account and given the same weight as the like interests of any other being
In Singer's view this means speciesism is equally unjustifiable as other forms of discrimination
- But what counts as having an interest and how can we know? (projection?)

### Other Objections against Specisism
Human beings that are not persons
- e.g. embryos, comatose people

Persons that are not human beings
- Speciesism could say that being human is not necessary for FMS but sufficient.
	- However, it seems often this is not actually the case when referring to specisism. It seems being human is seen as necessary and not sufficient if it is automatically assumed that non-humans do not have FMS (e.g. animals, lol)

Psychological Differences/Capacity
- Singer's objection
	- Argument from Marginal Cases (woooo)
		- Replies: bite the bullet (the least difficult and both best and worst one)
	- Why specifically this category and not any other?
		- It ought not matter the capacity, simply the interest (e.g. desire to avoid pain by intensity of pain caused)

**Argument against early Embryos and generally just "Future Potential" --> See Sinott-Armstrong's reply to Marquis**
All these arguments for future potential, not currently, etc. marginal cases but not really cases, jsut see SA reply.

**Just read DeGrazia 2016**


## Killing Happy Animals

Nonidentity problem
No moral reason to make a new animal
No moral reason not to 
Isn't this a flaw of a moral system?

Or just an Ambiguity (beauvoir link?)
