- The Good Will
	- It is the ultimate good
	- Everyone can upon reflection discover this (universitality)

Kant's position on the problem of moral luck and dependence
- Everyone ought to nonetheless. The luck of one situation or ability does not change the imperative duty or moral category; it is clear that the grudging person doing duty does it FOR duty and acts from it (but this does not make them better than the person who does it for duty and acts from it, and enjoys it too; only if one does it for enjoyment and not duty).
- Moral luck is not supposed to diminish the quality of morality. The results also do not diminish the moral character of the agent.
- Kant claims that one should not let kindness, goodness, the moral action, etc. DEPEND on enjoying it or the person receiving. You must make sure it is out of duty, not depending on something else, but this does not mean hating doing it.

There is a difference in kind between acting for duty and acting for your own happiness.
- When acting morally, your interest is in the action
- When acting non-morally, your interest is first and foremost in the result

**For Kant, goodness of what you can achieve is *different in kind* from the goodness of the Good Will** 

There is a higherarchical aesthetics of the differences in kind of goodnesses: e.g. goodness of effects and outcomes are inferior to the goodness of moral action and of the Good Will.

Necessity for ethics has a necessity different from the necessity of other things.
Example of making coffee. If you want to make coffee there is a necessity to buy the beans, boil water, etc., but you do not need to make the coffee.
For ethics, the necessity is not in the things you need to do to achieve something, but in the actual doing of the thing as such.

Law of universality: Categorical Imperative
- Everyone, at all times in history
Doing the non universalible thing affords to yourself a higher moral status than others such that you are allowed to make an exception for yourself.

A rule utilitarian would say the principle is immoral because if everyone followed it then we would be worse off. The Kantian does not claim this.
Kant asserts this principle is immoral because when we act upon it we contradict ourselves in a personal way. We assert *A*, and then proceed to contradict *A*.

Judging and acting morally are different things.
